# One 'ATT&CK' at a Time
Executing MITRE's ATT&amp;CK one TTP at a time. Community site for contributors coming soon - throw in a TTP and provide a detailed checklist, we'll give it a go and troubleshoot during a live stream. 
## Origin Story
This is a project that I started thinking of while performing single-execution threat emulation to evaluate the effectiveness of commercial SIEM products' rules, configurations and interoperability. The basic idea is to make a video and guided writeup for each of the MITRE ATT&CK TTP’s of the different techniques to execute. Sorta like Atomic but with a more “educational” twist.
